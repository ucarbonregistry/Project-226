6.3 MW Bundled Small Scale Wind Power Project (M/S M Hanumantha Rao) by Energy Advisory Services

The Project Titled “6.3 MW Bundled Small Scale Wind Power Project by M/s Hanumantha Rao” is a Wind based Power Project successfully commissioned by Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) and operational since 16/02/2015. The Project is owned by M/s Hanumantha Rao (hereby to be called as Project Proponent, PP).

There are social, environmental, economic and technological benefits which contribute to sustainable
development.

____________
Social Benefits:
• The project activity will lead to the development of supporting infrastructure such as road
network etc., in the wind park location, the access to which is also provided to the local
population.


• The project activity will lead to alleviation of poverty by establishing direct and indirect
benefits through employment generation and improved economic activities by strengthening
of local grid of the state electricity utility.


• Use of a renewable source of energy reduces the dependence on imported fossil fuels and
associated price variation thereby leading to increased energy security.


Environmental benefits:
• The project activity employs renewable energy source for electricity generation instead of
fossil fuel-based electricity generation which would have emitted gaseous, liquid and/or solid
effluents/wastes.


• Being a renewable resource, using wind energy to generate electricity contributes to resource
conservation. Thus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment
and contributes to environmental well-being.


Economic benefits:
• The project activity requires temporary and permanent, skilled and semi-skilled manpower at
the wind park; this will create additional employment opportunities in the region.


• The generated electricity will be fed into the NEWNE regional grid through local grid,
thereby improving the grid frequency and availability of electricity to the local consumers
(villagers & sub-urban habitants) which will provide new opportunities for industries and
economic activities to be setup in the area thereby resulting in greater local employment,
ultimately leading to overall development.


Technical benefits:
• Increased interest in wind energy projects will further push R&D efforts by technology
providers to develop more efficient and better machinery in future.
